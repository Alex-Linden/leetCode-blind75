"""write an algorithm which finds out elements which are largest
in a row and smallest in a column in a matrix

The first line of input consists of two space-
separated integers-
matrix row and matrix col, representing the
number of rows in the matrix (N) and the
number of columns in the matrix (M),
respectively.
The next M lines consist of N space-separated
integers representing the elements of the
matrix.
Output
Print a number which is largest in a row and
smallest in a column in the given matrix. If no
element is found print -1'.
Constraints
1 < N, M â‰¤ 1000
Note
Each number in the matrix is a non-negative
integer.
Example
Input:
22
12
34
Output:
2
Explanation:
The number 2 at index (0,1) is the largest in its
row and smallest in its column.
So, the output is 2."""
